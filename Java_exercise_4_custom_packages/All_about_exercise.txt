These classes should use inheritance to properly manage the code!
Include methods like volume,surface area and getters/setters for dimension



formulas

rectangle :

surface : 2*w+H
area: w*H

square:

surface : 2*a
area a*a

circle:

surface: 2*π*r
area:π*r*r



cylinder:
surface: πr*rh
area: 2πrh+2πr^2
